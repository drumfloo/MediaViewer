# MediaViewer
Angular app to show videos from YouTube-playlists on any screensize. Thanks to WebSocket, you can add a bunch of screens by open the app in a browser. All screens will play the selected video in sync, thanks to a Controller-app, you can select the pre-loaded videos from a specified list [`assets/credentials.json`]. I'm still working on it in my spare time, there are a lot of potential in it for some other kinds of usecases. 


## Change API-Key and/or Channel-Id
In case of changing the API-Kkey or playlist-Id, changes can be made here: `projects\zam-controller\src\assets\credentials.json`
