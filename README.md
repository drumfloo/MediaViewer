# MediaViewer
Angular app to show videos from YouTube-playlists on any screensize. Thanks to WebSocket, you can add a bunch of screens by open the app in a browser. All screens will play the selected video in sync, thanks to a Controller-app, you can select the pre-loaded videos from a specified list [`assets/credentials.json`]. I'm still working on it in my spare time, there are a lot of potential in it for some other kinds of usecases. 

Since it was a thesis, you can have a look at the documentation (german). This documentation covers the commercial aspects as well as the basics of implementation of the root project. However, only those of the initial project, not the extensions added after Juli 2024.

## Change API-Key and/or Channel-Id
In case of changing the API-Kkey or playlist-Id, changes can be made here: `projects\zam-controller\src\assets\credentials.json`
